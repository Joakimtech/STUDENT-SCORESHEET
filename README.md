**Student ScoreSheet Generator – Java Console Application**

A fully interactive **Java-based Student ScoreSheet Generator** that captures student details, computes marks, assigns grades, and generates class-level statistics — all through a simple console interface.

This project demonstrates how core Java concepts (variables, conditionals, loops, arrays, scanner inputs, arithmetic operations, and formatted output) can be combined to build a real-world academic reporting system.

 **How the Program Works**

1. The application starts by asking the user to enter the number of students (minimum 12).
2. For each student, the system collects:
   * Full Name
   * 6 Subject Marks
3. It calculates totals, averages, and grades instantly.
4. It aggregates class statistics.
5. It displays a beautifully formatted **Student Score Sheet**.
6. It prints **class-wide summary statistics** and **grade distribution**.

## **Project Overview**

**This Java application allows the user to enter academic records for**12 or more students.
It processes the raw mark inputs and generates:
* Individual student total marks
* Subject-level statistics
* Class-wide performance distribution
* Grade ranking based on total score

 **Computes automatically**
   *Total Marks per student
   *Average Marks per student
   *Grade per student* (based on defined grading scale)
  *Counts how many students scored each grade:

* Ranks students based on **total marks**

# **Below is the Grading Criteria used**

 * **Grade A** if the Total marks ≥ 540.
 * **Grade B** if the Total marks ≥ 480 and < 540.
 * **Grade C** if the Total marks ≥ 420 and < 480.
 * **Grade D** if the Total marks ≥ 360 and < 420.
 * **Grade F** if the Total marks < 360.

## **Class Statistics Generated**

The program automatically computes:

 **Per-Subject Analytics**
* Total marks scored by the entire class
* Average marks for each subject

  **Student Performance Analytics**
* Total marks for each student
* Assigned grade

 **Technologies Used**

* **Java 17+**
* **Scanner class** for user input
* **Arrays and loops** for data processing
* **Conditionals** for grade classification
* **Console formatting** using System.out.println()
